# LevelDB Database Decryptor

A simple Node.js command-line application to recover and decrypt an encrypted LevelDB (LDB) database. This tool uses the `crypto` module to decrypt the data and custom LDB parser and key derivation libraries to handle LevelDB operations and key derivation.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or newer)
- NPM

## Installation

Install the package globally

```bash
npm install -g @leanmull/leveldb-decryptor@latest
```

## Usage

Run the decryption script with the appropriate command-line arguments:

```bash
npx leveldb-decryptor "/path/to/ldb/file.ldb" your-password "/path/to/decrypted/ldb/file.json"
```

Replace `/path/to/ldb/file.ldb` with the correct path to your LDB file, `/path/to/decrypted/ldb/file.json` with the desired output path, and `your-password` with the actual password for your LDB file.

## Libraries

The application uses the following custom libraries:

- `ldb-parser`: A simple LevelDB parser library for interacting with LevelDB databases.
- `key-derivation`: A library for deriving a key from a password using the PBKDF2 algorithm.
